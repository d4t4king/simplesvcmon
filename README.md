# Setup/Install
## On a "bare bones"* system, you may need to install several packages and libraries.  This may include, but is not limited to, the following:
* python3
* python3 development libraries
* python3 pip
* build tools**
* libpcap
* libpcap development libraries
* git
* subversion

NOTE:  The packages above may be required on, for example, a minimal CentOS7 install.  I think modern Ubuntu derivatives (Desktop, Linux Mint, etc.) may have some of these packages installed already.
NOTE:  This should Just Work &#0153 on Kali Linux
