# simplesvcmon
python version of the perl/ruby service_monitor

# Setup/Install
## On a "bare bones"* system, you may need to install several packages and libraries.  This may include, but is not limited to, the following:
* python3
* python3 development libraries
* python3 pip
* build tools**
* libpcap
* libpcap development libraries
* git
* subversion

## The following python modules may also be required:
* termcolor
* untangle
* scapy
* sqlite3


NOTE:  The packages above may be required on, for example, a minimal CentOS7 install.  I think modern Ubuntu derivatives (Desktop, Linux Mint, etc.) may have some of these packages installed already.
NOTE:  This should Just Work &trade; on Kali Linux

# TODO
* create framework (cli/menu-driven/hybrid) mode -- aka metasploit type interface
* create daemon mode -- configure and forget
* bugfixes
* reports
